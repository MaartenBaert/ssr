Testing:

In progress:
- preview even when not recording yet (i.e. detach input from output)

Todo:
- Highlight mouse clicks (optional) [https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr/issues/10]

Wishlist:
- PulseAudio input (+ 2 inputs?)
- Built-in re-encoding after recording
- Separate file for each clip.
- clean up Global.h
- QuickLZ-based codec. (-> QuickLZ beta?)
- Better support for multiple GLInject windows.
- Easier GLInject application selection (as an alternative to entering the command).
- Timelapse recording, i.e. recording at a slow speed but playing it back faster (without sound obviously).
- maybe rewrite YUVConverter in assembly instead of using GCC vector extensions

Not sure yet:
- Fixed cursor position when using 'follow cursor'?
- tray icon?
- play start/stop sound?
- skip microphone startup click?
- redesigned interface? (https://github.com/swick/glc2/issues/1)
- equalizer?
- if possible, force fixed size on OpenGL applications? (optional of course)
