/*
A captured video stream is transmitted to SimpleScreenRecorder using shared memory files (i.e. files in /dev/shm).
The system is entirely lock-free and thread-safe, but supports only a single reader and a single writer.

There are two types of files:

>>>> /dev/shm/ssr-video-PID-SOURCE-DESCRIPTION <<<<
> PID is the process ID of the application, SOURCE is the source of the stream (should be unique for this process), DESCRIPTION can be anything.
> This file contains a GLInjectHeader struct followed by a GLInjectFrameInfo struct for each frame in the ring buffer.

>>>> /dev/shm/ssr-videoframeNUM-PID-SOURCE-DESCRIPTION <<<<
> NUM is the position of the frame in the ring buffer (starting from zero).
> This file contains one video frame. The file size is not constant, it may be enlarged when the video frame size changes. The size can only increase, not decrease.
